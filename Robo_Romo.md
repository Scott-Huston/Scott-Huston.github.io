Tony Romo is well known for correctly predicting NFL plays before they happen. For Robo Romo, I used a random forest model to automate the predictions and deployed the model to a user friendly web app using Plotly Dash.

- Random forest model
- User-input game state

Built using:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly Dash
- Heroku
